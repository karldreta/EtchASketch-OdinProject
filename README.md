## 7 APR 2024


## This is an Odin Project 

---- Had a lot of trouble along the way
--- At some point I somehow scaled the container instead of the boxes, but I fixed it using a formula for determining the width and height of the inner boxes (I had to use some fundamental geometry for this).

--- Had to go back to previous lessons for this, like the [JavaScript Mouse Events Tutorial](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-mouse-events/), check it out.

--- Got some awesome icons at: https://fontawesome.com/

--- The title font at: https://fonts.google.com/

## Aftermath

--- I think I finished the project now, 5 days since I started it. It was fun building it. 

--- I learned more about:

--- Adding elements to the DOM from inside the JS.
--- Looping an x number of inputs.
--- Events and Hovering.
--- Randomization of colors.


--- Also did the Extra Credits
--- I added some buttons to toggle
--- I know how to style buttons now base on their toggle states.
