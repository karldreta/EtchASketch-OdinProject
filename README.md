# Etch-A-Sketch: Odin Project

## 7 APR 2024


### This is an Odin Project 

* Had a lot of trouble along the way
* At some point I somehow scaled the container instead of the boxes, but I fixed it using a formula for determining the width and height of the inner boxes (I had to use some fundamental geometry for this).

* Had to go back to previous lessons for this, like the [JavaScript Mouse Events Tutorial](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-mouse-events/).

### Resources

### Aftermath

- The project took about 5 days to complete, and I enjoyed the process of building it.
- Key learnings include:
  - Adding elements to the DOM with JavaScript.
  - Looping through a number of inputs.
  - Handling events and hover effects.
  - Randomizing colors.

### Important Takeaway

- Gained a solid understanding of Flexbox properties for aligning boxes evenly inside a container.

### Extra Credits

- Added buttons to toggle features on and off.
- Learned how to style buttons based on their toggle states.
